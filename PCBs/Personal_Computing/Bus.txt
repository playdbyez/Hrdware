 - Lines or cables
 - Transfers information between components
 - Can be double-pumped or quad-pumped

[ ] Address bus:  
    - Uni-directional from CPU to RAM/Cache
    - Identifies the address location to read or write operations
    - Dictates the speed of the processor


[ ] Data bus:   
    - Bi-directional 
    - Identifies what data requires processing
    - Transmits from RAM to CPU, Hardware to CPU, Hardware to RAM, CPU to CPU and vice-versa
    - Ammount of data transmited accross the width of the data bus per cycle is dictated by the Word Size, usually 8 bytes per cycle
    - Prim. CPU to sec.CPU transmissions within the same architecture must cross the main memory (RAM)
    - Supports Direct Memory Acess (DMA) which is a way of accessing RAM from Hardware without crossing the CPU


[ ] Control bus:  
    - Determines whether the CPU is receiving or sending data
    - Control lines permit the bus to send read or write signals to memory
    - Transmits clock pulses and activity synchronization data in order to time processes
      Common signals:
                 [IRQ] Interrupt request    : From hardware to CPU, interrupts the CPU's current task to prioritise hardware signals
                 [CCL] System Clock Control : Resposible for the timing of devices on the motherboard and CPU



[] Frequencies:
   A quad-pumped 200MHz bus is advertised as a 800MHz bus.
-   800MHz
-   1066MHz
-   1333MHz
-   1600MHz
 


[] Double-pumped
   Data is transmitted two times per cycle.

[] Quad-Pumped
   Data is transmitted four times per cycle.
