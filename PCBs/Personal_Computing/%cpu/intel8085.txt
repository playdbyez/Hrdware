###### :: Central Processing Unit Intro :: #####

[] CPUs are organized into nodes
[] A single quad-core CPU is capable of supporting 16 Virtual Processors
[] Each core has a copy of all hardware resources
[] Any core is able to work independently of eachother unless they are acessing the same resource
[] Instruction decoding within a processor can be speed p by caching the decoded instructions

[] Intel's hyper-threading allows a single processor to run two concurrent executions simultaneously
[] Symmetric multiprocessing systems (SMP)  are expected to use NUMA





:: Common System Interface (CSI) ::
[] Developed by Intel to replace the Front Side Bus (FSB) 
[] CSI is a Non-Uniform Memory Architecture (NUMA) that consists of attaching local memory to each CPU core internally
[] Each memory bank however must be accessible to any given core via the interconnects attached to each core 
[] Crossing interconnects directly affects the CPU's time/efficiency
[] The time to access local memory within a cpu node can be either uniform or have small NUMA factor

Quad-core CPU = 4 local memory banks
CPU1 accesses local memory 1 = no interconnects are crossed
CPU1 accesses remote memory2 = one interconnect is crossed
CPU1 accesses remote memory4 = two interconnects are crossed
