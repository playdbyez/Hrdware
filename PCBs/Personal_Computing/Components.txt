#### CPU components ####

[] Control Unit
   - Moves data around the system
   - Sends signals to hardware


[] Airthmetic Logic Unit
   - Performs calculations
   - Gateway between primary memory and storage memory


[] Registers
   - High speed memory for small data
   - Stores address of next instruction to execute
   - Storest current instructiong decogin
   - Stores calculation results
   - Different types are implemented
          > Program Counter
          > Accumulator
          > Memory address register
          > Memory data register
          > Current instruction register


[] Cache
   - High speed version of RAM 
   - Supporting feature built into the CPU
   - Holds data that the processor is likely to access
   - Expensive per physical size
   - Two types are implemented
          > L1 cache: Used more frequently
          > L2 cache: Used less frequently


[] Buses
 - Transfers information between components
 - Different types are implemented
         > Address bus:  Uni-directional from CPU to RAM/Cache
                         Identifies the address location to read or write operations
                         Dictates the speed of the processor

           > Data bus:   Bi-directional 
                         Identifies what data requires processing
                         Transmits from RAM to CPU, Hardware to CPU, Hardware to RAM, CPU to CPU and vice-versa
                         Ammount of data transmited accross the width of the data bus per cycle is dictated by the Word Size, usually 8 bytes per cycle
                         Prim. CPU to sec.CPU transmissions within the same architecture must cross the main memory (RAM)
                         Supports Direct Memory Acess (DMA) which is a way of accessing RAM from Hardware without crossing the CPU

         > Control bus:  Determines whether the CPU is receiving or sending data
                         Control lines permit the bus to send read or write signals to memory
                         Transmits clock pulses and activity synchronization data in order to time processes
                         Common signals:
                                        [IRQ] Interrupt request    : From hardware to CPU, interrupts the CPU's current task to prioritise hardware signals
                                        [CCL] System Clock Control : Resposible for the timing of devices on the motherboard and CPU



[] ######## Secondary Motherboard Components ########## []

[] Read-Only Memory (ROM)
 - Non-Volatile
 - Stores BIOS Configuration
          > BIOS: Software Instruction-set for ROM
                  Deployed by the manufactorer
                  Stores services/device drivers
