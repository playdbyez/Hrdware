############ PERFORMANCE METRICS ##############

[] DDR Notation []
DRAM uses a special notation to determine the performance of its module based on the graph above

NOTATION
w-x-y-z-T

w   CL
x   t(rcd)
y   t(rp)
z   t(RAS)
T   T1 or T2

[] The BIOS sets the dafault values for the memory signals bellow within "programmable registers" placed inside a RAM module.
   BIOS may also allow changing some or all of these values depending on the quality of the RAM.
   WARNING: Changing these parameters may affect the stability of the system.

[] The notation (t(RP)+t(RCD)+CL >= t(RAS)) must be true in order to preven a stall of the next t(RP) 




###############################

[] Clock ratio []
Considers the combination of CPU and memory ctonroller frequnecy in order to determine
how many CPU cycles are stalled per stall cycles occuring in memory

> Quad-pumped intel Core2 Processor (freq. 2.933GHz)
> FSB/MMU bus (freq. 1.066GHz)
>> Clock Ratio of 11:1 (11 CPU stalls occur per one memory stall)

 [] Burst speed [] 
Maxmum transfer rate of memory via data bus

FORMULA
Bus freq(MHz)  x  RAM freq(Bytes) = BURST (GB/s)

EXAMPLE
> quad-pumped 200MHZ bus
> 8byte RAM freq

Since this RAM module is capable of filling a bandwith of 8 bytes worth of data transfer
(200 * 4) * 8
800 * 8 = 6400

> 6.4 GB/s Burst Speed



 [] Current DQ frequency [] 
Distance from one DQ signal before t(RP) to nother DQ signal in cycles

FORMULA 
2 DQ signals / (cycles distance/100) = Current DQ freq


EXAMPLE
> DQ signal 1 issued at cycle[2]
> DQ signal 2 issued at cycle[9]
  >> Distance of 7 cycles

Since DQ was in use in 2 out of 7 cycles
2/0.07 = 28.5714

> Current frequence of usage is 28.5% out of the total bandwith available


 [] Bus Usage []
How often the data bus is being currently used

FORMULA 
Curr DQ x Burst Speed = Bus Usage (GB/s)


EXAMPLE
28.5714 * 6400 = 182856.96

>> The current bus usage of the data bus by the memory is of 1.8 GB/s
>>> This is deemed unoptimal compared with maximum it could be, determined by the burst speed
>>>>> Thus the current bus usage is 72% less than the maximum available
