[] Slower and cheaper than Static RAM 
[] Smaller in size and thus easier to pack large ammounts together 
[] Simpler gate schematic but power hungry design
################ ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS ###############
[] Capacitor []
   - Stores the state of the cell 
   - The state is determined through a positive charge or a negative charge
   - Its capacity is low and in the femto-farad range or lower
   - Its resistance is high and around two tera-ohms
[] Transistor []
   - Guards the current from accessing the capacitor's state
   - Determines if weather the capacitor can be read or writen at any given time
[] Data Line []
   - Determines wheater a specific cell will recieve a new flow of current or not
[] Acess Line []
   - Acts as a switch for the current to flow in and out
[] Sense Amplifier []
   - Distinguishes between 0 and 1 used to transmit forward 
   - Distinguishes between a new flow or no flow to feedback to the discharged capacitor
   - Feedback to the depleated capacitor requires an new charge to flow.
   
C = Capacity
R = Resistance
RC = Resistance x Capacity (measured as a unit of time)
################# ELECTRIC OPERATIONS #################
[] Read []
Access Line is raised
Current is pulled or not from Capacitor to Data Line 
Discharges the Capacitor
[] Write []
Access Line is raised
Data Line drains or charges the Capacitor cell to a new state


[] Refresh []
Since a read operation will discharge the Capacitor
Since due to the resistance on the Capacitor, it may suffer from "leakage" as the charge dissipates from it after some time has passed
A refresh cycle must be carried out every 64ms to recharge the Capacitor
During this cycle, no access to the cell is possible which compromises time/efficiency
