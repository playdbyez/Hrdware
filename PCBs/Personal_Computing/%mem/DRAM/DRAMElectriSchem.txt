[] Slower and cheaper than Static RAM 
[] Smaller in size and thus easier to pack large ammounts together 
[] Simpler gate schematic but power hungry design


################ ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS ###############

[] Capacitor []
   - Stores the state of the cell 
   - The state is determined through a positive charge or a negative charge
   - Its capacity is low and in the femto-farad range or lower
   - Its resistance is high and around two tera-ohms

[] Transistor []
   - Guards the current from accessing the capacitor's state
   - Determines if weather the capacitor can be read or writen at any given time

[] Data Line []
   - Determines wheater a specific cell will recieve a new flow of current or not

[] Acess Line []
   - Acts as a switch for the current to flow in and out

[] Sense Amplifier []
   - Distinguishes between 0 and 1 used to transmit forward 
   - Distinguishes between a new flow or no flow to feedback to the discharged capacitor
   - Feedback to the depleated capacitor requires an new charge to flow.


Power = Dynamic Capacity x VoltageÂ² x Frequency
C = Capacity
R = Resistance
RC = Resistance x Capacity (measured as a unit of time)


################# ELECTRIC OPERATIONS #################
[] Read []
Access Line is raised
Current is pulled or not from Capacitor to Data Line 
Discharges the Capacitor

[] Write []
Access Line is raised
Data Line drains or charges the Capacitor cell to a new state


[] Refresh []
Since a read operation will discharge the Capacitor
Since due to the resistance on the Capacitor, it may suffer from "leakage" as the charge dissipates from it after some time has passed
According to the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council  specification (JEDEC) a refresh cycle must be carried out every 64ms to recharge the Capacitor
A DRAM module keeps track of the last refreshed row via a counter that automatically increases 
Duration of the refresh cycle depends on the RAM module
During this cycle, no access to the cell is possible which compromises time/efficiency
Retrieving a word froma row thaat is currently being refreshed will stall the processor


[] Within a clock cycle, signals are issued on the rising line of the clock (middle vertical line)
