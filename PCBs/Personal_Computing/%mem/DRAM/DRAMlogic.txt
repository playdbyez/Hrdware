############[] Dynamic Random Access Memory []###########

[] A DRAM chip is made up of several cells organised in rows and columns
[] DRAM chips usualy consist of 10⁹ cells
[] DRAM's transfer rate is 64 bits (8bytes)
[] Synchronous DRAM works relative to a clock frequency
[] Said clock frequency determines the speed of the parallel data bus attached to it

[] DQ pins specify the number of bits processed by the CPU at once in "words"
[] Word sizes range from 4 to 80 bits 
[] DRAM implements 64 bit words (8bytes)
[] DRAM allows the MMU to dictate how much data to transfer (2, 4, 8 words)

[] An address of 2ᴺ select lines is multiplexed into an address of N address lines
[] DRAM demultiplexes N address lines and selects the equivalent memory cell

[] Fully duplex parallel bus is expensive
[] Asynchronous DRAM is no longer relevant







##################### [] RAM GATE CONNECTORS [] #######################
[] A RAM's parameters are to be ploted within a Connectors Activity graph, mapped against clock as a measure of time.
[] A single clock cycle is comprised to two horizontal lines and two vertical lines
[] Within a clock cycle, signals are issued on the rising line of the clock (middle vertical line)


####################################### :: Parameters :: #######################################

CLK = Clock
[] Time measurement for the occurence of the signals


WE   = Write Enable
[] Allows the current to flow through a row of cells


tᵣₚ  = Row Precharge Time 
[] Used to indicate how many cycles it takes to select a new RAS signal after a previous RAS has been issued
[] Issued only at the end of the CL cycles
[] Can only be re-issued again after t(RAS) cycles


RAS  = Row Address Selection
[] Selects a row of cells based of the demultiplexed address
[] tᵣₚ cycles always preceed an RAS signal


tᵣ꜀ₔ = RAS-to-CAS delay
[] A delays that must occurr after an RAS signal and a CAS signal


CAS  = Column Address Selection
[] Selects columns of cells within a row
[] RAS signal always preceeds CAS signals


CL   = CAS Latency
[] A delay that must occur after all CAS signals have been issed for a particular row
[] CL always preceeds the DQ output

DQ = Output pins
[] Used for transmiting data input when overwriting cells within the array or data output when reading cells back to the MMU

tᵣₐₛ = Active to Precharge delay
[] Fixed value that dictates the minimum mmount of cycles that must exist inbetween tᵣₚ signals 


Tx   = Command Rate
[] Used for controlling the frequency of  CAS signals
[] Tx is a standard, not a signal to be plotted within the grap
[] x can be either a 1 or a 2 (T1/ T2)
[] T1 = high-performance Dram module
[] T2 =

################# MEMORY OPERATIONS #################

[] After considering t(RAS) for the module, the MMU specifies if the row will be latched for longer depending on how many columns will be fetched within it.
[] t(RP) signal is issue vie WE and RAS being raised simultaneously
[] RAS signal waits for the completion of t(RP) cycles
[] At the end of t(RP), RAS signal is issued and the row is latched
[] CAS signal waits for t(RCD) cycles before fetching one or more columns
[] At the end of CAS, DQ pins must wait for CL cycles
[] DQ issues out a word and a new t(RP) signal may be issued simultaneously, but only if t(RAS) cycles have passed

<+> Ideally several CAS signals should be issued on the same RAS
<+> Ideally t(RP) cycles should take as long as the data being sent out by DQ in order to prevent any stall cycles on the next RAS
<+> Hardware and software prefetching can be used to reduce stalls
<+> The lower the CL the faster the module
<+> Faster buses are superior to faster CL

######## :: Single Data Rate Dynamic Random Access Memory (DDR DRAM):: #########

[] Has only one parallel data bus connected to each array of cells (single-pumped)
[] Transmits one word per clock cycle
[] Word size 64 bits
[] Data transfer rate is equal to the bus frequency



Name                              PC100     
Array freq. p/data line           100MHz

######## :: Double Data Rate Dynamic Random Access Memory (DDR DRAM):: #########
   Double Data Rate DRAM is the successor to Single data Rate DRAM and it innovates by increasing the throughput.
   DDR modules managed to increase the output of each array of cells without increasing the frequency of which the cells are retrieved.
   This was done by increasing the bus frequency but not the frequency of the array, thereby reducing the transfer time of DQ pins without affecting the latency
   This reduction of the transfer time is then made possible because an I/O buffer component was added to each array's Data Line.
   An I/O buffer is designed to hold an ammount bits per data line current that flows per clock cycle

[] Each channel supports two parallel data buses (double-pumped)
[] Each array of cells is attached to two Data Lines (double-pumped)
[] Its cell array operates at half the frequency of its external data bus
[] DQ pins can transmit on the rising and falling vertical lines of the clock 
[] Word size 64 bits
[] Transfers 2 words p/clock cycle 
[] I/O buffer capacity of 2 bits



######## :: Double Data Rate 2 (DDR2 DRAM):: #########
   DDR2 inovates from DDR1 by optimising the bus frequency and increasing the ammount of Data Lines.
   DDR2 specification allows a most 2 modules per channel and 4 modules connected to each memory controller/MMU.

[] Each single channel supports four parallel data buses (quad-pumped)
[] Each array then supports 4 Data lines (quad-pumped)
[] Word size 64 bits
[] Transfers 4 words p/clock cycle 
[] Runs at 1.8V on a quad-pumped bus
[] I/O buffer capacity of 4 bits
