###### :: Common System Interface (CSI) :: #######
[] Developed by Intel to replace the Front Side Bus (FSB) 
[] CSI is a Non-Uniform Memory Architecture (NUMA) that consists of attaching local memory to each CPU core internally
[] Each memory bank however must be accessible to any given core via the interconnects attached to each core 
[] Crossing interconnects directly affects the CPU's time/efficiency

Quad-core CPU = 4 local memory banks
CPU1 accesses local memory 1 = no interconnects are crossed
CPU1 accesses remote memory2 = one interconnect is crossed
CPU1 accesses remote memory4 = two interconnects are crossed
