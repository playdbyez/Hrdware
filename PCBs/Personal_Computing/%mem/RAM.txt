### RAM Intro ###

[] 1GB of RAM has 2⁸ address lines
[] A RAM module is a collection of RAM chips
[] Different types of RAM require different memory management units

[] Single Data Rate RAM transmits one word per clock cycle (1word p/2 ticks)
[] Double Data Rate RAM transmits two words per clock cycle (2words p/2 ticks)
[] Quad-pumped bus means 4 data lines per array of memory cells



## Processing Overview ##
> Programs selects memory location
> Operating System translates memory location into a virtual address
> MMU translates it into Physical Address via its hardware specific Page tables
> MMU transmists via Address Bus
> RAM chip corresponding to said address is selected
> RAM transmits back via data bus
 
>> First RAS multiplexes its address and transmits it back to CPU
>> Subsequently CAS multiplexes its address and transmits it back to CPU
