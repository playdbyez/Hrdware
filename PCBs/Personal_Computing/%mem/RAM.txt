[] Intel's Common System Interface was developed in to replace the FSB (CSI)
[] CSI is a Non-Uniform Memory Architecture that consists of attaching local memory to each CPU core internally.
   However each memory bank must be accessible to any given core via the interconnects attached to each core which
   affects the CPU's time/efficiency.

CPU1 accesses memory2 = one interconnects are crossed
CPU1 accesses memory4 = two interconnects are crossed
Quad-core CPU = 4 local memory banks
