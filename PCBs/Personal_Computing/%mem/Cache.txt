### Cache ####

[] Implemented over a Static RAM architecture
[] Transparently administered by the processor
[] Holds temporary copies of data from RAM
[] By default all reads abnd writes are stored in the cache asn an entry
[] CPUs first search the cache for addresses as accessing the cache takes less clock cycles than accessing RAM
[] Certain memory regions cannot be cached and separate caches for data and code is the optimal approach
[] Depending on its implementation, either virual or physical addreses are cached
[] 1/1000th of the size of memory (System has 4MB cache with 4GB RAM)
[] L1 cache is denoted as the fastest level
[] As the levels of cache increase each unit becomes bigger and slower

[] Working Set is the set of data currently worked on
[] Working set size refers to the total ammount of memory used at one time
