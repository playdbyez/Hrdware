############[] Dynamic Random Access Memory []###########

[] A DRAM chip is made up of several cells organised in rows and columns
[] DRAM chips usualy consist of 10⁹ cells
[] Asynchronous DRAM is no longer relevant
[] DRAM's transfer rate is 64 bits (8bytes)
[] Synchronous DRAM works relative to a clock frequency
[] Said clock frequency determines the speed of the data bus attached to it

[] DQ pins specify the number of bits processed by the CPU at once in "words"
[] Word sizes range from 4 to 80 bits 
[] DRAM implements 64 bit words (8bytes)
[] DRAM allows the MMU to dictate how much data to transfer (2, 4, 8 words)

[] An address of 2ᴺ select lines is multiplexed into an address of N address lines
[] DRAM demultiplexes N address lines and selects the equivalent memory cell

[] Dual In-line Memory Model (DIMM)


> Programs selects memory location
> Operating System translates memory location into a virtual address
> MMU translates it into Physical Address via its hardware specific Page tables
> MMU transmists via Address Bus
> RAM chip corresponding to said address is selected
> RAM transmits back via data bus


 
>> First RAS multiplexes its address and transmits it back to CPU
>> Subsequently CAS multiplexes its address and transmits it back to CPU




##################### DRAM GATE CONNECTORS #######################
[] A DRAM's parameters are to be ploted within a Connectors Activity graph, mapped against clock as a measure of time.
[] A single clock cycle is comprised to two horizontal lines and two vertical lines
[] Within a clock cycle, signals are issued on the rising line of the clock (middle vertical line)


####################################### :: Parameters :: #######################################

CLK = Clock
[] Time measurement for the occurence of the signals


WE   = Write Enable
[] Allows the current to flow through a row of cells


tᵣₚ  = Row Precharge Time 
[] Used to indicate how many cycles it takes to select a new RAS signal after a previous RAS has been issued
[] Issued only at the end of the CL cycles


RAS  = Row Address Selection
[] Selects a row of cells based of the demultiplexed address
[] tᵣₚ cycles always preceed an RAS signal


tᵣ꜀ₔ = RAS-to-CAS delay
[] A delays that must occurr after an RAS signal and a CAS signal


CAS  = Column Address Selection
[] Selects columns of cells within a row
[] RAS signal always preceeds CAS signals


CL   = CAS Latency
[] A delay that must occur after all CAS signals have been issed for a particular row
[] CL always preceeds the DQ output

DQ = Output pins
[] Used for transmiting data input when overwriting cells within the array or data output when reading cells back to the MMU

tᵣₐₛ = Active to Precharge delay
[] Fixed value that dictates the minimum mmount of cycles that must exist inbetween tᵣₚ signals 


Tx   = Command Rate
[] Used for controlling the frequency of  CAS signals
[] Tx is a standard, not a signal to be plotted within the grap
[] x can be either a 1 or a 2 (T1/ T2)
[] T1 = high-performance Dram module
[] T2 =

################# MEMORY OPERATIONS #################

[] Although there is a minimum time for how long the row must remain latched [t(RAS)]
   The MMU specifies if the row will be latched for longer depending on how many columns will be fetched within it.

[] t(RP) signal is issue vie WE and RAS being raised simultaneously
[] RAS signal waits for the completion of t(RP) cycles
[] At the end of t(RP), RAS signal is issued and the row is latched
[] CAS signal waits for t(RCD) cycles before fetching one or more columns
[] At the end of CAS, DQ pins must wait for CL cycles
[] DQ issues out a word and a new t(RP) signal may be issued simultaneously, but only if t(RAS) cycles have passed

<+> Ideally several CAS signals should be issued on the same RAS
<+> Ideally t(RP) cycles should take as long as the data being sent out by DQ in order to prevent any stall cycles on the next RAS

############ PERFORMANCE METRICS ##############

[] DRAM uses a special notation to determine the performance of its module based on the graph above

NOTATION
w-x-y-z-T

w   CL
x   t(rcd)
y   t(rp)
z   t(RAS)
T   T1 or T2






 [] Burst speed [] 
Maxmum transfer rate of memory via data bus

FORMULA
Bus freq(MHz)  x  RAM freq(Bytes) = BURST (GB/s)

EXAMPLE
> quad-pumped 200MHZ bus
> 8byte RAM freq

Since this RAM module is capable of filling a bandwith of 8 bytes worth of data transfer
(200 * 4) * 8
800 * 8 = 6400

> 6.4 GB/s Burst Speed



 [] Current DQ frequency [] 
Distance from one DQ signal before t(RP) to nother DQ signal in cycles

FORMULA 
2 DQ signals / (cycles distance/100) = Current DQ freq


EXAMPLE
> DQ signal 1 issued at cycle[2]
> DQ signal 2 issued at cycle[9]
  >> Distance of 7 cycles

Since DQ was in use in 2 out of 7 cycles
2/0.07 = 28.5714

> Current frequence of usage is 28.5% out of the total bandwith available


 [] Bus Usage []
How often the data bus is being currently used

FORMULA 
Curr DQ x Burst Speed = Bus Usage (GB/s)


EXAMPLE
28.5714 * 6400 = 182856.96

>> The current bus usage of the data bus by the memory is of 1.8 GB/s
>>> This is deemed unoptimal compared with maximum it could be, determined by the burst speed
>>>>> Thus the current bus usage is 72% less than the maximum available




















######## :: Single Data Rate Dynamic Random Access Memory (DDR DRAM):: #########
