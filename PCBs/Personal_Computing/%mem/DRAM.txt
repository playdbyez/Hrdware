############[] Dynamic Random Access Memory []###########

[] A DRAM chip is made up of several cells organised in rows and columns
[] DRAM chips usualy consist of 10⁹ cells
[] Asynchronous DRAM is no longer relevant
[] DRAM's transfer rate is 64 bits (8bytes)
[] Synchronous DRAM works relative to a clock frequency
[] Said clock frequency determines the speed of the data bus attached to it

[] Slower and cheaper than Static RAM 
[] Smaller in size and thus easier to pack large ammounts together 
[] Simpler gate schematic but power hungry design


################ ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS ###############

[] Capacitor []
   - Stores the state of the cell 
   - The state is determined through a positive charge or a negative charge
   - Its capacity is low and in the femto-farad range or lower
   - Its resistance is high and around two tera-ohms

[] Transistor []
   - Guards the current from accessing the capacitor's state
   - Determines if weather the capacitor can be read or writen at any given time

[] Data Line []
   - Determines wheater a specific cell will recieve a new flow of current or not

[] Acess Line []
   - Acts as a switch for the current to flow in and out

[] Sense Amplifier []
   - Distinguishes between 0 and 1 used to transmit forward 
   - Distinguishes between a new flow or no flow to feedback to the discharged capacitor
   - Feedback to the depleated capacitor requires an new charge to flow.
   

C = Capacity
R = Resistance
RC = Resistance x Capacity (measured as a unit of time)


################# ELECTRIC OPERATIONS #################

[] Read []
Access Line is raised
Current is pulled or not from Capacitor to Data Line 
Discharges the Capacitor


[] Write []
Access Line is raised
Data Line drains or charges the Capacitor cell to a new state


[] Refresh []
Since a read operation will discharge the Capacitor
Since due to the resistance on the Capacitor, it may suffer from "leakage" as the charge dissipates from it after some time has passed
A refresh cycle must be carried out every 64ms to recharge the Capacitor
During this cycle, no access to the cell is possible which compromises time/efficiency



##################### DRAM Logic Process #######################

:: Parameters ::
WE   = Write Enable
RAS  = Row Address Selection
CAS  = Column Address Selection
CL   = CAS Latency
tᵣ꜀ₔ = RAS-to-CAS delay
tᵣₚ  = Row Precharge Time       
tᵣₐₛ = Active to Precharge delay
T   = Command Rate
CLK = Clock

[] A DRAM's parameters are to be ploted within a graph against clock as a measure of time
[] A clock cycle is comprised to two horizontal lines
[] Within a clock cycle, signals are issued on the rising line of the clock



[] DRAM uses a special notation to determine the performance of its module
NOTATION
w-x-y-z-T

w   CL
x   t(rcd)
y   t(rp)
z   t(RAS)
T   T1 or T2









################# MEMORY OPERATIONS #################

> Programs selects memory location
> Processor translates it into Physical Address via its hardware specific Page tables
> CPU transmists via Address Bus
> RAM chip corresponding to said address is selected
> RAM transmits back via data bus


[] An address of 2ᴺ select lines is multiplexed into an address of N address lines
[] DRAM demultiplexes N address lines and selects the equivalent memory cell 
[] First RAS multiplexes its address and transmits it back to CPU
[] Subsequently CAS multiplexes its address and transmits it back to CPU
[] CAS data is available after CL cycles
