############[] Dynamic Random Access Memory []###########

[] A DRAM chip is made up of several cells organised in rows and columns
[] DRAM chips usualy consist of 10⁹ cells
[] Synchronous DRAM works relative to a clock frequency
[] Slower and cheaper than SRAM
[] Small in size and thus easier to pack large ammounts together 
[] Simpler gate schematic but power hungry design
[] Asynchronous DRAM is no longer relevant
[] Said clock frequency determines the speed of the data bus attached to it
[] Different types of RAM require different memory management units

################ ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS ###############

[] Capacitor []
   - Stores the state of the cell 
   - The state is determined through a positive charge or a negative charge
   - Its capacity is low and in the femto-farad range or lower
   - Its resistance is high and around two tera-ohms

[] Transistor []
   - Guards the current from accessing the capacitor's state
   - Determines if weather the capacitor can be read or writen at any given time

[] Data Line []
   - Determines wheater a specific cell will recieve a new flow of current or not

[] Acess Line []
   - Acts as a switch for the current to flow in and out

[] Sense Amplifier []
   - Distinguishes between 0 and 1 used to transmit forward 
   - Distinguishes between a new flow or no flow to feedback to the discharged capacitor
   - Feedback to the depleated capacitor requires an new charge to flow.
   




################# ELECTRIC OPERATIONS #################

[] Read []
Access Line is raised
Current is pulled or not from Capacitor to Data Line 
Discharges the Capacitor


[] Write []
Access Line is raised
Data Line drains or charges the Capacitor cell to a new state


[] Refresh []
Since a read operation will discharge the Capacitor
Since due to the resistance on the Capacitor, it may suffer from "leakage" as the charge dissipates from it after some time has passed
A refresh cycle must be carried out every 64ms to recharge the Capacitor
During this cycle, no access to the cell is possible which compromises time/efficiency







##################### INDEX #######################

C = Capacity
R = Resistance
RC = Resistance x Capacity
     measured as a unit of time

RAS = Row Address Selection
CAS = Column Address Selection
WE  = Write Enable

RAM modules = Collection of RAM chips
CL = CAS Latency
tᵣₚ = Row Precharge Time
     measured in cycles as a unit of time 




################# MEMORY OPERATIONS #################

> Programs selects memory location
> Processor translates it into Physical Address via its hardware specific Page tables
> CPU transmists via Address Bus
> RAM chip corresponding to said address is selected
> RAM transmits back via data bus


[] An  address of 2ᴺ select lines is multiplexed into an address of N address lines
[] DRAM demultiplexes N address lines and selects the equivalent memory cell via RAS operation
[] First RAS multiplexes its address and transmits it back to CPU
[] Subsequently CAS multiplexes its address and transmits it back to CPU
[] CAS data is available after CL cycles
