############[] Dynamic Random Access Memory []###########

[] A DRAM chip is made up of several cells organised in rows and columns
[] DRAM chips usualy consist of 10⁹ cells
[] Asynchronous DRAM is no longer relevant
[] DRAM's transfer rate is 64 bits (8bytes)
[] Synchronous DRAM works relative to a clock frequency
[] Said clock frequency determines the speed of the data bus attached to it

[] DQ pins specify the number of bits processed by the CPU at once in "words"
[] Word sizes range from 4 to 80 bits 
[] DRAM implements 64 bit words (8bytes)
[] DRAM allows the MMU to dictate how much data to transfer (2, 4, 8 words)

[] An address of 2ᴺ select lines is multiplexed into an address of N address lines
[] DRAM demultiplexes N address lines and selects the equivalent memory cell

[] Dual In-line Memory Model (DIMM)

[] Slower and cheaper than Static RAM 
[] Smaller in size and thus easier to pack large ammounts together 
[] Simpler gate schematic but power hungry design


################ ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS ###############

[] Capacitor []
   - Stores the state of the cell 
   - The state is determined through a positive charge or a negative charge
   - Its capacity is low and in the femto-farad range or lower
   - Its resistance is high and around two tera-ohms

[] Transistor []
   - Guards the current from accessing the capacitor's state
   - Determines if weather the capacitor can be read or writen at any given time

[] Data Line []
   - Determines wheater a specific cell will recieve a new flow of current or not

[] Acess Line []
   - Acts as a switch for the current to flow in and out

[] Sense Amplifier []
   - Distinguishes between 0 and 1 used to transmit forward 
   - Distinguishes between a new flow or no flow to feedback to the discharged capacitor
   - Feedback to the depleated capacitor requires an new charge to flow.
   

C = Capacity
R = Resistance
RC = Resistance x Capacity (measured as a unit of time)


################# ELECTRIC OPERATIONS #################

[] Read []
Access Line is raised
Current is pulled or not from Capacitor to Data Line 
Discharges the Capacitor


[] Write []
Access Line is raised
Data Line drains or charges the Capacitor cell to a new state


[] Refresh []
Since a read operation will discharge the Capacitor
Since due to the resistance on the Capacitor, it may suffer from "leakage" as the charge dissipates from it after some time has passed
A refresh cycle must be carried out every 64ms to recharge the Capacitor
During this cycle, no access to the cell is possible which compromises time/efficiency




##################### DRAM GATE CONNECTORS #######################
[] A DRAM's parameters are to be ploted within a Connectors Activity graph, mapped against clock as a measure of time.
[] A single clock cycle is comprised to two horizontal lines and two vertical lines
[] Within a clock cycle, signals are issued on the rising line of the clock (middle vertical line)


#################### :: Parameters :: ################

CLK = Clock
[] Time measurement for the occurence of the signals


WE   = Write Enable
[] Allows the current to flow through a row of cells


tᵣₚ  = Row Precharge Time 
[] Used to indicate how many cycles it takes to select a new RAS signal after a previous RAS has been issued
[] Issued only at the end of the CL cycles


RAS  = Row Address Selection
[] Selects a row of cells based of the demultiplexed address
[] tᵣₚ cycles always preceed an RAS signal


tᵣ꜀ₔ = RAS-to-CAS delay
[] A delays that must occurr after an RAS signal and a CAS signal


CAS  = Column Address Selection
[] Selects columns of cells within a row
[] RAS signal always preceeds CAS signals


CL   = CAS Latency
[] A delay that must occur after all CAS signals have been issed for a particular row
[] CL always preceeds the DQ output

DQ = Output pins
[] Used for transmiting data input when overwriting cells within the array or data output when reading cells back to the MMU

tᵣₐₛ = Active to Precharge delay
[] Fixed value that dictates the minimum mmount of cycles that must exist inbetween tᵣₚ signals 


Tx   = Command Rate
[] Used for controlling the frequency of  CAS signals
[] Tx is a standard, not a signal to be plotted within the grap
[] x can be either a 1 or a 2 (T1/ T2)
[] T1 = high-performance Dram module
[] T2 =

[] DRAM uses a special notation to determine the performance of its module
NOTATION
w-x-y-z-T

w   CL
x   t(rcd)
y   t(rp)
z   t(RAS)
T   T1 or T2

















################# MEMORY OPERATIONS #################

> Programs selects memory location
> Operating System translates memory location into a virtual address
> MMU translates it into Physical Address via its hardware specific Page tables
> MMU transmists via Address Bus
> RAM chip corresponding to said address is selected
> RAM transmits back via data bus


 
[] First RAS multiplexes its address and transmits it back to CPU
[] Subsequently CAS multiplexes its address and transmits it back to CPU

[] Although there is a minimum time for how long the row must remain latched [t(RAS)]
   The MMU specifies if the row will be latched for longer depending on how many columns will be fetched within it.

[] t(RP) signal is issue vie WE and RAS being raised simultaneously
[] RAS signal waits for the completion of t(RP) cycles
[] At the end of t(RP), RAS signal is issued and the row is latched
[] CAS signal waits for t(RCD) cycles before fetching one or more columns
[] At the end of CAS, DQ pins must wait for CL cycles
[] DQ issues out a word and a new t(RP) signal may be issued simultaneously, but only if t(RAS) cycles have passed

> Ideally several CAS signals should be issued on the same RAS
> Ideally t(RP) cycles should take as long as the data being sent out by DQ in order to prevent any stall cycles on the next RAS
