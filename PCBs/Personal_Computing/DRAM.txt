############[] Dynamic Random Access Memory []###########

A DRAM chip is made up of several cells organised in rows and columns.
Slower and cheaper than SRAM
Small in size and thus easier to pack large ammounts together 
Simpler electric schematic
Less power hungry design
Asynchronous DRAM is no longer relevant.
Synchronous DRAM works relative to a clock frequency. 
Said clock frequency determines the speed of the data bus attached to it.

################ ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS ###############

[] Capacitor []
   - Stores the state of the cell (charged / not charged)

[] Transistor []
   - Guards the current from accessing the capacitor's state

[] Data Line []
   - Determines wheater a specific cell will recieve a new flow of current or not

[] Acess Line []
   - Acts as a switch for the current to flow in and out

[] Sense Amplifier []
   - Distinguishes between 0 and 1 used to transmit forward 
   - Distinguishes between a new flow or no flow to feedback to the discharged capacitor
   - Feedback to the depleated capacitor requires an new charge to flow.
   




################# ELECTRIC OPERATIONS #################

[] Read []
Access Line is raised
Current is pulled or not from Capacitor to Data Line 
Discharges the Capacitor


[] Write []
Access Line is raised
Data Line drains or charges the Capacitor cell to a new state


[] Refresh []
Since a read operation will discharge the Capacitor
Since due to the resistance on the Capacitor, it may suffer from "leakage" as the charge dissipates from it after some time has passed
A refresh cycle must be carried out every 64ms to recharge the Capacitor
During this cycle, no access to the cell is possible which compromises time/efficiency







##################### INDEX #######################

C = Capacity
R = Resistance
RC = Resistance x Capacity
     measured as a unit of time

RAS = Row Address Selection
CAS = Column Address Selection
WE  = Write Enable

RAM modules = Collection of RAM chips
CL = CAS Latency
tᵣₚ = Row Precharge Time
     measured in cycles as a unit of time 




################# MEMORY OPERATIONS #################

> Programs selects memory location
> Virtual Address is generated
> Processor translates Virtual Address into Physical Address via its hardware specific Page tables
> CPU transmists via Address Bus
> RAM chip corresponding to said address is selected


[] An  address of 2ᴺ select lines is multiplexed into an address of N address lines
[] DRAM demultiplexes N address lines and selects the equivalent memory cell via RAS operation
[] First RAS multiplexes its address and transmits it
[] Subsequently CAS multiplexes its address and transmits it
[] CAS data is available after CL cycles
