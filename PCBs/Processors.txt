[ASIC] Application-Specific Integrated Circuit
	- Costly
	- Aimed at processing data for a single application per chip
	- Cannot be reprogrammed after manufacture
	- Switches, USB chargers, Toys
	- ASIC Cryptominers [CKB Miner]> GraphicsCard (GOLDSHELL CK6)
Manufactoring Options:
	- Semi-Custom (Design logic gates connections)
	- Full-Custom   (design every transistor from scratch)
 
 
#####
[FPGA] Field-Programmable Grade Arrays
 	Designed be reprogramable through Hardware Description Language (Verilog HDL, VHDL)
	- Less powerful than ASIC
	- Xilinx
