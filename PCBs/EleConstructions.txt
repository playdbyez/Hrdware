Supporting components such as, resistors, transistors, transformers, capacitors and other integrated circuits 
Are mounted on a PCB's copper foil track petterns
Via soldering or pinning down said electronics parts together
Guided by an entry on the Electrician's guide, 
About the use of an adiabatic equation for calculating the correct size for an earth conductor
Or calculating the ammount of time taken for a conductor to exceed its limiting temperature.

:::::: :: Capacitors :: :::::::
This component consists of two metal plates seperated by an insulating layer called the Dielectric.
Its purpose is to measure Capacitance in units of farads (F) 
while abiding by a Working Voltage and operating within a certain ammount of Tolerance,
in which, both should not be exceeded.

Non-Electrolytic capacitors are differentiated by 
the substance that makes up its dielectric insulation,
which includes Polycarbonate, Polypropylene, Polyester, Polystyrene, Mica and Ceramic.

//Capacitors Types:
<> Electrolytic Capacitor
<> Non-Electrolytic Capacitor
<> Variable Capacitor


//Capacitor Units
Microfarad (uF) =  1 uF
Nanofarad  (nF) =  0.001 uF
Picofarad  (pF) =  0.000001 uF
