Supporting components such as, resistors, transistors, transformers and capacitors, 
Are mounted on a PCB's copper foil track petterns
Via soldering or pinning down said electronics parts together
Guided by an entry on the Electrician's guide, 
About the use of an adiabatic equation for calculating the correct size for an earth conductor
Or calculating the ammount of time taken for a conductor to exceed its limiting temperature.
